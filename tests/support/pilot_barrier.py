"""A Pilot wait that also drains what the messages it waited for posted in turn.

Textual 8.2.7's ``Pilot._wait_for_screen`` queues one callback behind whatever the App and
each widget of the current screen hold when it starts, and returns once every callback has
run. A handler that runs inside that window and posts on — a Button's ``Pressed`` bubbling to
the App, a dismissal replacing the screen, a widget handing its layout request to the screen
when it goes idle — leaves work the wait never covered. Pilot then relies on ``wait_for_idle``,
which calls the process idle once a 20 ms sleep burns no CPU time. A starved runner burns none
while it is descheduled, and Windows counts process time in 15.6 ms ticks, so the probe returns
with that work still queued and the test reads state from before it ran.

This wait queues the callback again on every pump of the current screen that still holds a
message or a pending callback, or is still inside a handler — a pump takes a message off its
queue before it runs the handler, so an empty queue alone says nothing — re-reading the screen
each round because a dismissal changes it, until a round finds nothing left. Work that runs
outside a pump — a worker, a task, a timer — is not a message, so a test still waits for the
state that work produces.

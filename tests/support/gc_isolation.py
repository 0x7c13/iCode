"""Keep a timed test window from paying for the heap earlier tests left behind.

An xdist worker keeps whatever every earlier test left alive. A full
collection that starts inside a test walks all of it: tens of milliseconds
locally, but up to ten seconds on a loaded macOS runner. That is enough to fail
a 5 s budget or an "it returned promptly" bound, however fast the code under
test was. Objects frozen with :func:`gc.freeze` are skipped by every
collection, so a collection inside the block walks only what the block itself
allocated.

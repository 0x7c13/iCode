# ``create_client`` returns an open stack (SDK client plus the httpx pool Chrys
# built for it) that nothing closes implicitly: the stack is not an async
# context manager and ``Agent.__aexit__`` never sees it. Each call site
# registers exactly one close owner with no ``await`` between the factory's
# return and the registration. Keys are ``<src path>::<qualified function>``;
# values name that owner. ``async with scoped_client(...)`` is compliant by
# construction and needs no entry.

"""Show a hook's ``ask`` to the ACP client as a standard ``session/request_permission``.

One per ACP session, owned by it (``ManagedSession``) and closed with it, however
the session ends. Out of band: the requests and withdrawals arrive through
session-level subscriptions, never through the prompt's serialized event
loop, so a new input's own check (whose hooks run while that input is still
being published) reaches the client too, and a waiting question never holds
up the model's other output. A request handler only claims, records and
starts a task, then returns; the task asks the client and publishes the one
answer as soon as the client gives it. The question's card is then settled with
a terminal ``tool_call_update`` (``completed`` once allowed, ``failed``
otherwise), as is a withdrawn request's, whose task is cancelled: cancelling the
JSON-RPC wait alone leaves the client's dialog open until the turn ends, and an
answered card would stay pending. The update goes out once, as one step every
caller drains, so a withdrawal or close landing while it is being sent never
leaves the card open; it never holds up the answer, whose timeliness is the
user's, not the client's rendering.

The question has an id of its own (``hook-confirm-<request>``), which no
tool card carries. Clients show either the title or the content depending
on the kind, so each says on its own which hook asks, why, and about what.
All text here is protocol output and stays English.

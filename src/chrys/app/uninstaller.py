"""``icode uninstall``: remove an offline install, or say how to remove any other kind.

An offline install is the PyApp binary ``icode install`` copied onto PATH plus the runtime PyApp
unpacked on first run. uv, pipx and pip keep their own records of what they installed, so for
those this only prints the command that removes the app. The data folder, which holds settings,
API keys, model profiles, agents, skills and sessions, stays unless ``--purge`` is given.

"""Replace a ``Static``'s content, laying the screen out only when the widget's geometry changes.

``Static.update()`` defaults to ``layout=True``. A layout request from a widget in the chat
transcript clears the arrangement of every auto-sized ancestor up to the chat panel and makes the
Screen reflow, and the reflow's cost grows with the mounted transcript. Running tool cards update a
spinner frame eight times a second, an elapsed-time label once a second and a streamed output tail
per line, and almost none of those updates changes the widget's size.

Textual caches each widget's box model per set of arrangement inputs and reuses it until the widget
itself requests a layout; a content change that skips the layout therefore must leave the box model
unchanged. Only an ``auto`` width or height reads the content, so a widget without either never needs
one. Otherwise the new content is measured the way the arrangement measures it, at the laid-out
width, and compared with the laid-out size: the width and height the arrangement last gave the
widget are fixed points of its clamping, so an equal measurement yields the same box model.

Geometry comes from ``outer_size``, which the last arrangement stored on the widget. ``size`` and
``region`` look the widget up in the compositor map, which an offscreen repaint invalidates, so
reading them could rebuild the map for the whole transcript.

"""Ctrl+Insert / Shift+Insert clipboard fallbacks shared by the app and modal screens.

Chrys editors bind the Insert clipboard keys themselves so image paste and
Vim mode gating run first. These fallbacks serve everything else: text
selected on a screen and stock Textual controls. They are non-priority
bindings, so they only run after the focused widget declined the key.

Textual stops the non-priority binding chain at a ``ModalScreen``, which
hides the application-level copy of these bindings from every modal dialog.
Modal roots therefore spread :data:`INSERT_CLIPBOARD_BINDINGS` into their own
``BINDINGS`` and mix in :class:`InsertClipboardScreenMixin` for the actions.

"""A program running on a pseudo-terminal, the same to its owner on every platform.

POSIX gives the owner a file descriptor to read and write. Windows gives it a ConPTY, which is a
terminal emulator in its own right: it keeps a screen, and after a resize it sends that screen
again. `PtyProcess` is what the two have in common, and `repaints_after_resize` the one difference
an owner has to know about.

"""The rows of a diff: what each line on display stands for.

A diff is computed as hunks of line opcodes and shown as rows. A row says what kind of line it is,
which line of the old and of the new text it shows, and carries the highlighted code. Everything a
renderer needs to draw a line is on its row, so the widgets share one list of rows and nothing has
to be kept in step with it.

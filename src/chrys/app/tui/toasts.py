"""Toasts under the header, the newest on top.

Textual appends each new toast under the older ones and scrolls its rack to
the end, which stacks a bottom-docked rack upward from the newest toast.
Chrys docks the rack under the header instead (``chrys.tcss``), so the stack
grows downward: new toasts mount ahead of the older ones and the rack keeps
its start in view.

"""Workflow hook lifetimes: session attachments outlive individual run resources.

Browsing history is passive. First admitted execution attaches a session (start
for a new session, restored for an existing one); later runs may reload hook
configuration without synthesizing another session lifetime. Host shutdown or
explicit session release ends the attachment. Run hooks are observers, once per
admitted run, including cancellation and failure.

    (ticket -> StaleContinuation, no ticket -> PreparedClosed), overlap,
    intent/content table, then live-ticket identity/origin validation.

    input are admission errors. After admission, provider/validation/pass-hook
    failures return Failed (possibly without an exception for an ACP stop reason).

    propagates CancelledError after convergence. Shells retain their own terminal

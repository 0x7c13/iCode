"""Publish invocation facts with identity captured before asynchronous work.

Callers bind an immutable InvocationOrigin to a BoundEmitter for each invocation.
Shared model callbacks use invocation_routing_key only to find that registered
publisher, then retain the emitter across awaits and registry release. Neither
current_invocation_origin nor the routing key repairs a missing event origin.

Turn, kernel child and ACP child facts share the Invocation event family. Caller
commands, permission/ask-user correlation and acquire diagnostics keep their own
protocols; frontend consumers select the existing projection by origin.kind.
